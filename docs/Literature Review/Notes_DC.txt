Notes on Literature:

#########Tandberg & Hillman:############

As stated does not account for different levels of PBF.
Includes PBF and OBF as the same treatment.

Not sure whyu it says treatment effect in table 3 is "small  and significant" the treatment effect
parameter does not seem to be significant in any of the models.

Table 4 not sure why certain years are significant accross the board but others are not.

Not sure this is quantitive evidence that longer durations have effects - consider bernoulli 
selecting which out of the 11 durations were significant - does not seem unreasonable to have
drawn years 6,8,11 as significant, if all years are equally likely to be significant.




########Slaughter et. al :#############

Only considers OBF - does not consider states history of PBF
