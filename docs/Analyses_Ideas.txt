Poisson Count model for number of bachelor degrees awarded.

Fit our poisson GLM.
Do we need negative binomial since can't graduate more people than enrolled, likely not more than
enrollment/4. Should check this for robustness.

Need to use log link function?

Look at distributions of first differences on:
1) Proportion of spending on instruction
2) Proportion of spending on student services
3) Proportion of spending on administration
4) 

Cluster standard errors on institutions, include effects for time. Talk about if we can do this
clusterisation simulataneously - mentioned before.


Throw some regularised learning algorithms at the un-restricted data set and see if we come
up with anything that is interpretable - removes the element of selecting which variables to
include. Train on 4 year universities, then use this to test on some other set e.g. 2 year
universities.
